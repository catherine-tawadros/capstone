hello again steven i have written most of the code for my neural network for my 349 assignment
which i will be repurposing for this project
the neural network part itself does not work yet as i was watching the lecture on backpropagation when you interrupted my coding
however the perceptrons and each individual layer work which is cool and fun
you can take a look at that it's in a bunch of python files which i will modify and expand upon next week
then i will input my little audio data and we will see what happens
have a good evening lmk when my ihop comes
